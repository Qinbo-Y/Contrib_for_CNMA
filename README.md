The function **`cnma_contrib (x, "component", "inactive", random, kmax)`**  is used to compute and output the results of pseudo-path identification and flow allocation in CNMA.

Arguments:

  - x: An object of class 'discomb' or 'netcomb', available for both additive and interaction models.
  - component: A character string defining the target component whose contribution is to be analyzed.
  - inactive: A character string defining the inactive (reference) treatment component.
  - random: A logical indicating whether a random-effects CNMA should be conducted.
  - kmax: Maximum length of pseudo paths to consider. Default is 4.

Returns three data frames:
  - Paths: pseudo paths and their assigned flows (œÜ) representing contributions to the target component.
  - Proportion_for_edges: proportional contributions of each edge in the CNMA network.
  - Comparisons_in_CNMA: original study-level comparisons, their CNMA model representation, 
    and whether they contributed to the integrated direct estimate.
